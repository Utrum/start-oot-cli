# How to start OOT daemon

## Windows

On Windows, the easiest way to install the daemon is just running Agama with OOT activated in native mode. 

## Linux

You can also install Agama and run it with OOT activated in native mode. 

There's also the Docker method, for servers, for example:

1. Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
2. Modify `assetchain-start.sh` with custom rpc user and password
3. Run it: `bash assetchain-start.sh`
